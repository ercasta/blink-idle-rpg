# Example environment variables for docker-compose
# Point PROJECT_ROOT to the folder that contains the `game/` directory.
# Default (recommended): the compose file directory (relative).
PROJECT_ROOT=./

# Example Windows absolute path (uncomment and edit if needed):
# PROJECT_ROOT=C:/Users/you/path/to/blink-idle-rpg

# Notes:
# - Docker Compose automatically loads a .env file placed next to docker-compose.yml.
# - Use absolute paths on Windows to avoid path translation issues.
# - After editing .env, restart the stack: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build`.
